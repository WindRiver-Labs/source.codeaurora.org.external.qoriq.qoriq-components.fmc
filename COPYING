Special Notes on Selected Files
-------------------------------

Some files in the Freescale FMC package are generated from skeleton files
associated with the Flex and Bison programs.

The Bison skeleton files are distributed under GPLv2 but with the following
special exception (which applies to the Freescale FMC package):

   As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
   part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
   parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
   as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
   the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
   special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
   Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
   License without this special exception.

The Flex skeleton file is unrestricted.  It's License statement states,
in reference to the license of the flex tool itself (which is 2-clause BSD):

  Note that the "flex.skl" scanner skeleton carries no copyright notice.
  You are free to do whatever you please with scanners generated using
  flex; for them, you are not even bound by the above copyright.

Only the generated scanner is contained in the Freescale FMC package.
